# WeCitizens.be : Microsoft Word add-in

This add-in was developed for Microsoft Word, on [Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/), in Javascript, HTML and CSS.

It will not be available on the official Office store, because we cannot publish it without paying (check https://dev.office.com/docs/add-ins/publish/publish for further details). 
You will need Visual Studio to run the project and try the add-in.

Finally, we are not able yet to load the online database of the politicians, due to security restrictions in Windows products. We can load it locally, but the user of the add-in has to give it.

In spite of these issues, the search algorithm for spotting politicians, which is the core of the add-in, is almost finished. It can thus be a nice foundation to produce a fully accomplished Word add-in.
## Important files
The project depends on many files created automatically by Visual Studio when creating a new project. However
the files needed to develop the add-in are "classic" web files: a Javascript, HTML and CSS file.
These files are located in __WeCitizens_Word/WeCitizens_WordWeb__.
- __Home.js__ : contains the main Javascript code which handles the behaviour of the add in
- __Home.html__ and __Home.css__ : defines the layout and the structure of the add-in
